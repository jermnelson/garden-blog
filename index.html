       Strawberry Patch Two
      </h1>
      <p>
       Sunday I arrived back from a professional conference in Boston and
yesterday as I was looking at the first Strawberry patch on the 
enclosed side of the house, I noticed a ripe strawberry that I picked
and enjoyed just a taste of the hopefully, more to come in the
upcoming years. On the opposite side of the house is a 
second patch on side of the hill pictured below:

       Second Sisters Planting
      </h1>
      <p>
       The weather this past week in Colorado Springs ranged from snow
to rain until today with the sun provided an opportunity to go outside and
engage the garden.
      </p>
      <p>
       Earlier in the spring I started a seed starter grow station in my 
garage that provide the source seeds in my first foray into a three
sister's planting. Starting withe the seedlings with the most 
growth pictured here:

       Here are the seedlings near the final position in the garden 
patch before being planted this afternoon:

       Here is the final planting using soil from the existing 
compost augmented with some dirt from a purchased bag of 
garden soil:

       New Compost Bag, Onion and Roses Bed
      </h1>
      <p>
       Yesterday I went to my new favorite
       <a href="https://www.goodearthgardencenter.com/">
        garden-center
       </a>
       and 
purchased a "
       <a href="https://smartpots.com/compostsak/">
        compost sak
       </a>
       " for the 
front yard. This morning I set-up the sack and placed next to the gate to the backyard
(see the photo below)
I picked up the remaining cuttings from my trimming the yew bushes in
the front as well as a round of weeding the front yard.

      </p>
      <p>
       Later in the afternoon, I weeded and watered the onion and rose bed which you see
in the second photo below. Also, you can start to get a sense of the hill in the 
backyard as well.

       I should confess that an important source of inspiration is watching through
Monty Don series on Netflix, with my wife and I watching the second episode in the
French gardens series. Today I first heard the French style of kitchen garden,
or portage, from the French word for soup, were herbs, fruits, vegetables, and 
flowers are all combined into an integrated whole with the focus on the vegetables.
Just a quick internet search turned up two articles,
       <em>

      <h1>
       Weeding Dandelions
      </h1>
      <p>
       The rain of the past two days in Colorado Springs resulted in a
number of dandelions popping up in the front-yard. Between meetings
this afternoon, I picked a few and then took the first photo
of my weeding tools and bucket, along with the largest patch of these
"weeds". Most weeds I don't have any qualms about removing them from the
front lawn or in the various garden beds but I am ambivalent about dandelions
because, unlike many of the weeds, they are edible and I feel like instead of
composting them, I should clean and prep them for a meal.
       <br/>
       <img alt="tools and dandelions" src="img/20190423_dandelion.jpg"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       I also came across this multi-colored, that I believe is a
pansy that grew from seed as a part of last year's pansies in the front-yard beds.

       Berry Hedge Beginnings
      </h1>
      <p>
       My stepdaughter Meghan and I planted a few weeks three berry bushes,
a red raspberry, a black raspberry, and a blackberry bushes at the
top of my Pike Peak's foothill backyard. As seen in the photo below,
I labeled each of the new bushes with an unique IRI built using the EFF's dice
word-list to generate random three-word phrases as names instead of me trying
to come up with new names and ids for the plants I want to track.

       Initial Garden Reflections
      </h1>
      <p>
       Starting today, I write to reflect on today's work in my garden, 
located on the Westside of Colorado Springs. Most of my backyard is
the side of a foothill that with it's siblings, merges west into 
Pikes Peak.
      </p>

       My current work is in a rose garden that over the past years I've lived
here, I've routated between the roses, loosely-called compost pits. 
Finally this year, I'm actually planting both onions and
