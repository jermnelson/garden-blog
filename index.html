      <h1>
       Onions and Roses, Purple Fungus, and Cherry Tomatoes
      </h1>
      <p>
       When I got home from Aikido practice, I started weeding the back, 
in, what I got a little chuckle in the bad pun
       <em>
        Onions and Roses
       </em>
       rock band,
       <br/>
       main growing bed in the back-yard. As I was removing the morning glories vines
from the bed as they crowd out the onions, in the photo below you can
the row of onions are next to stone wall on the right with the roses on 
the left.
      </p>
      <p>
       <img alt="Row in the Onions and Roses Bed" src="img/20190810_onions-roses.png"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was removing these vines, I thought of my role in the garden as the 
fitness function of these adaptive systems of grow plants. My intention in 
removing unwanted plants is improve the environment for the plants that I 
want to thrive and succeed. But, I was looking at these particular morning
glory vines and how resilient and tough these plants are, I wonder for the 
2020 growing season that I plant and start early climbing peas in the same 
areas and try to grow them as a replacement in the niche currently being 
exploited to great effect by these climbing vines.
      </p>
      <h2>
       Purple Fungus
      </h2>
      <p>
       Since 2013, my first spring and summer in this house, I have notices this
purple fungus on many of the weeds in both the front and back. On the
south side of the house (what I'm now going to start call Strawberry Row,
as the strawberry plants there are doing well) there was a particularly
bad patch I took the following photo of one plant with leaves in various
stages of infection:
      </p>
      <p>
       <img alt="Purple Fungus on Plant Leaves" src="img/20190810_purple-fungus-plant-leaves.png"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not sure what this fungus does or is called but since it seems to only infect
(so far as I can tell) common weeds that I would have normally picked anyways). 
I was able figure it out in 5 minutes of web research but I'll continue to look 
into this. In the meantime, when I pick these infected weeds I'm isolating them
from my two compost bins and my plan is to burn them once they dry out.
      </p>
      <h2>
       Cherry Tomatoes
      </h2>
      <p>
       So my cherry tomato plant impulse buy started producing and ripening small tomatoes
that I have started picking and eating once ripe! here is a close shot of a ripe
tomato on that plant that I also took today:

      <h1>
       Removing Dead Bushes, Weeding, and Watering
      </h1>
      <p>
       For the past couple of weeks I've either been out-of-town (last
week at this time I was finishing up a 5-day Aikido Summer Camp in 
the Rockies at
       <a href="http://boulderaikikai.org/">
        Boulder Aikikai
       </a>
       ) or
haven't done much gardening other than weeding and watering the
onion bed and the new tomato plant.
      </p>
      <p>
       The four bushes my wife purchased earlier in the summer are all dried
up and look died. I'm not sure if was the lack of watering initially
or for some other reason, one problem with the bushes location on the
backyard hill is that water retention isn't great. When I went up the
hill today to look at the four bushes, I noticed green leaves sprouting
on a couple of the branches in one of the bushes picture below.
      </p>
      <p>
       <img alt="Hillside Dry Shrub" src="img/20190804_dry-shrub.png"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       The next time we plant a bush or tree on the hill we should look at using
       <br/>
       drip irrigation to ensure a consistent supply of water. Disappointing
for sure.

       Onion Bed Weeding and new Cherry Tomato Container
      </h1>
      <p>
       During my lunch 1/2 hour today, I briefly went through and weeded the
onion bed in the back yard. Most of the weeds are off-shoots of the climbing
vine that has a mass of roots through-out the bed. I imagine as an underground
network spreading out and finding its way for any opportunity to burst 
through a weak spot or sunny location in the onion bed to send up a quick
growing shoot.
      </p>
      <p>
       This weekend in a fit of consumer loss of will-power, I purchased a large 
cherry tomato plant within it's own container that I have put in the
front sidewalk, pictured here:

       The second largest rose bush in the back garden
recently bloomed. In the past and up until recently,
all of the Roses in the back-yard were red.

       Back from Trip &amp; Weeding
      </h1>
      <p>
       Late Wednesday night I flew back to Denver and then took the shuttle
from DIA to the Antlers Hotel in Colorado Springs. Yesterday I spent
the day mostly in bed recovering from a summer chest cold (still not
100%) but today I was able to do some weeding in the onion bed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feeling the warmth and brightness of the sun on my face, I hope
when I'm recovering from a future illness I'll be able to garden
a bit.

       Yew Bushes Trimming &amp; Bees in the Lavender
      </h1>
      <p>
       This morning and afternoon started with picking weeds in
the both the backyard onion patch and in the lawn before I mowed.
I then shot the following video of bees and flies pollinating
       <br/>
       the lavender bushes in the front:

      <p>
       Later in the afternoon, I went back to trimming a yew bushes in the
front. Under the bushes is a rock border that I wanted to reveal 
that was over-grown. I cut them back as seen in this photo:

       Yesterday, my wife Melissa went to a large retail tool and garden center and purchased a
number of flowers for the front-yard. The red geraniums and yellow lilies really stand-out 
surrounded by the lavender bushes.

       None of the initial "three" sisters planting of corn, eggplant, and green beans came up
and since I have initial seedlings ready for planting, I decided to replant the

      <p>
       Sunday I arrived back from a professional conference in Boston and
yesterday as I was looking at the first Strawberry patch on the 
enclosed side of the house, I noticed a ripe strawberry that I picked
and enjoyed just a taste of the hopefully, more to come in the
upcoming years. On the opposite side of the house is a 
second patch strawberry patch on side of the hill pictured below:

       Second Sisters Planting
      </h1>
      <p>
       The weather this past week in Colorado Springs ranged from snow
to rain until today with the sun provided an opportunity to go outside and
engage the garden.
      </p>
      <p>
       Earlier in the spring I started a seed starter grow station in my 
garage that provide the source seeds in my first foray into a three
sister's planting. Starting withe the seedlings with the most 
growth pictured here:

       New Compost Bag, Onion and Roses Bed
      </h1>

       Yesterday I went to my new favorite
       <a href="https://www.goodearthgardencenter.com/">
        garden-center
       </a>
       and 
purchased a "
       <a href="https://smartpots.com/compostsak/">
        compost sak
       </a>
       " for the 
front yard. This morning I set-up the sack and placed next to the gate to the backyard
(see the photo below)
I picked up the remaining cuttings from my trimming the yew bushes in
the front as well as a round of weeding the front yard.

       Later in the afternoon, I weeded and watered the onion and rose bed which you see
in the second photo below. Also, you can start to get a sense of the hill in the 
backyard as well.

       I should confess that an important source of inspiration is watching through
Monty Don series on Netflix, with my wife and I watching the second episode in the
French gardens series. Today I first heard the French style of kitchen garden,
or portage, from the French word for soup, were herbs, fruits, vegetables, and 
flowers are all combined into an integrated whole with the focus on the vegetables.
Just a quick internet search turned up two articles,
       <em>

       Weeding Dandelions
      </h1>
      <p>
       The rain of the past two days in Colorado Springs resulted in a
number of dandelions popping up in the front-yard. Between meetings
this afternoon, I picked a few and then took the first photo
of my weeding tools and bucket, along with the largest patch of these
"weeds". Most weeds I don't have any qualms about removing them from the
front lawn or in the various garden beds but I am ambivalent about dandelions
because, unlike many of the weeds, they are edible and I feel like instead of
composting them, I should clean and prep them for a meal.
       <br/>
       <img alt="tools and dandelions" src="img/20190423_dandelion.jpg"/>

       I also came across this multi-colored, that I believe is a
pansy that grew from seed as a part of last year's pansies in the front-yard beds.

       Berry Hedge Beginnings

      <p>
       My stepdaughter Meghan and I planted a few weeks three berry bushes,
a red raspberry, a black raspberry, and a blackberry bushes at the
top of my Pike Peak's foothill backyard. As seen in the photo below,
I labeled each of the new bushes with an unique IRI built using the EFF's dice
word-list to generate random three-word phrases as names instead of me trying
to come up with new names and ids for the plants I want to track.

       Initial Garden Reflections

      <p>
       Starting today, I write to reflect on today's work in my garden, 
located on the Westside of Colorado Springs. Most of my backyard is
the side of a foothill that with it's siblings, merges west into 
Pikes Peak.

       My current work is in a rose garden that over the past years I've lived
here, I've routated between the roses, loosely-called compost pits. 
Finally this year, I'm actually planting both onions and
