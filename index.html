      Cleaning up Lavender Beds
     </h1>
     <p>
      This morning I worked in the front yard cleaning up the lavender beds by removing
leaves and the old stems. Here is the yard before the clean-up (along with our black
cat Rocky crossing in the background):

      Removing the dead stems and leaves took some time and even then there still needs to be
another round of leave clean-up as seen in this after photo:

      Seed Grow Station
     </h1>
     <p>
      After being inspired last
      <a href="#2020/03-12">
       Thursday
      </a>
      , I started my indoors seed starting
station and went ahead and created three of the egg carton seed packs. I also planted
a micro-greens pot and in another pot planted one of the onion bulbs from last year. 
Some of the last year's seed pods were re-hydrated and planted some of the remaining
beans and squash seeds.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the photo below, the egg carton seed cartons in the black trey are from front to the
back:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       The three sisters - corn, green beans, and zucchini
      </li>
      <li>
       Tomatoes from the super successful cherry tomato plant from last season and pumpkin
    seeds from last fall, and some beets seeds from Ann Grant Martin
      </li>
      <li>
       Arugula, Kale, and Spinach

     <p>
      The two brown bottles hold water and in the lower-left corner there is a couple of 
my paint brushes (my easel is adjunct to the grow station) are in jar with paint thinner.
Because of the COVID-19 virus imposed social distancing, all of my family is staying at
home. Being able to start on the cultivating seedlings for this season's garden provides
a much needed balance and connection to the larger reality beyond the fear of the 
ongoing pandemic.

      Onions in Early March
     </h1>
     <p>
      Last fall I didn't harvest very many onions that were the Rose bed because most 
of them have died or so I assumed from the lack of green tips. Last week I 
noticed as the weather in Colorado Springs has improved, that some of those
abandoned onions are sprouting back up with the most prominent pictured 
below:
     </p>
     <p>
      <img alt="Onion Sprout" src="img/020200312_onion.png"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      Last weekend I put on my todo list to start the seedlings for planting this
spring and I always seem to have an excuse. I need to get the light fixed and
most of the first two trays planted, perferrable this afternoon. This year
I am using cardboard egg cartons for containers to hold the seeds. The added
advantage is that I can use a pen to mark what is where.
     </p>
     <p>
      My immediate goal is the create a three-sisters planting on a single six-egg
carton and then tranport them to the very successful cherry tomato planter from
the last year. I am curious to see if the container is too constraining for the corn 
or if all three plants (the other two being beans and squash) can survive as a well.
     </p>
     <p>
      It would be nice if I could cultivate the three-sisters in this manner.

      Re-potting the Lemon Tree
     </h1>
     <p>
      I think the size of the pot for my new lemon tree was too small and too much of the
root crown was exposed. I had an extra plastic container that moved the lemon tree 
into that does a better job of covering the roots and gives the tree more room to grown.
In the small window of sun shine during the 20 degree Fahrenheit day, I replanted and
took this photo (I wish it was warm as it looks, the sun in Colorado is always deceptive 
during the winter)
     </p>
     <p>
      <img alt="Lemon Tree" src="img/20200213_lemon-tree.png"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      The bottom of the lemon tree's container has a reservoir to store extra water so I hope 
that will help reduce the occurrence of all of the soil being dried up that was part of
the issue with the smaller terracotta pot.

      California Dreaming
     </h1>
     <p>
      For my first blog post of 2020 (and it being winter here in Colorado Springs) I 
decided to replant a lemon tree I purchased late last year into it's own pot.
     </p>
     <p>

     <p>
      When I am in Palo Alto, my cube on the Lanthrop third floor looks into a courtyard that 
contains lemons and kumquats in planters. When I was there last week, the lemons were
starting to ripen. These lemons are delicious and so inspired me to buy and try to keep
living my lemon tree. I did notice that the pot I picked is about the same size and 
container I purchased with the roots being container bound. I'll likely need to purchase 
a larger pot this summer.

      Final Thoughts for 2019
     </h1>
     <p>
      As the last day of 2019, my garden adventures for the year are complete 
with very mixed results. I killed too many
      <a href="#2019/04-20">
       plants
      </a>
      and
      <a href="#2019/09-10">
       here
      </a>
      ,
I failed in both planting
      <a href="#2019/05-03">
       seedlings
      </a>
      and from most of onions I planted int
the ground. My notable successes were with container plants, both onions and the
      <a href="#2019/08-10">
       cherry tomato
      </a>
      plant. I did a lot of
      <a href="/#2019/08-04">
       weeding
      </a>
      and
      <a href="#2019/09-10">
       bush removals
      </a>
      along with other gardening work around the house. In all, 
even though most of my ambitions was folly, documenting my experiences in this blog 
and spending time gardening was a source of deep satisfaction and humbling of my 
initial hubris.

      2020 New Year Garden Resolutions
     </h2>
     <p>
      Looking over the past year, here are my gardening goals for the new year:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Start seedlings sooner, allow them to grow larger before planting in the
    ground and in containers
      </li>
      <li>
       More of mix between in-ground plantings and container gardening
      </li>
      <li>
       Plant less perennials
      </li>
      <li>
       Start a drip irrigation system for at one of the new beds
      </li>

      Harvesting Container Onions
     </h1>
     <p>
      The weather forecast for Colorado Springs is snow for the next couple 
of days so I decided to harvest three of the onions in the long 
container before the snow starts coming down. I picked the three
 and noticed although the size of the onions where not great, the
length of the roots was significant and think the long rectangular 
box was too shallow for the deep rooted onions for next season's
garden. Here are the three onions freshly picked with the rich soil 
still attached:
     </p>
     <p>
      <img alt="Three Onions before the snow storm" src="img/20191027_3-onions.png"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      After cleaning the onions, I decided to keep one of the larger onions
with the most roots out to plant in my internal winter garden in a
deeper pot but I chopped up the small onion and the other larger one in 
a pan with carrots that eventually became the base for the bean soup
for Sunday's dinner:

      <img alt="Carrots and Onion cooking" src="img/20191027_onions-carrots.png"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      This is after all the ultimate goal for my gardening efforts this year 
and for this blog was to at least to supplement the diet of myself and 
my family going into the winter.

      Growing season Wind Down
     </h1>
     <p>
      The latest weather forecast for Colorado Springs calls for snow and drastically
reduced high temperature in 30s Fahrenheit. I decided to move the one remaining
tomato plant indoors and see if I can keep the plant alive as long as possible
in my portable grow station. This cherry tomato plant has been the most
productive plant in this season's garden adventures and it will be an interesting
experiment to see how long this plant lives indoors. I decided to hold off in 
harvesting the remaining onions in the rose bed and in the long container.

      Back from Sweden; Tomatoes and Garden Center
     </h1>
     <p>
      Last week I was in Stockholm at the National Library for a conference 
where I presented on two different panels related to my work as software
engineer. Before I left, I thought I gave instructions for watering
the cherry tomato plant that is now in the backyard. This morning I
harvested three tomatoes and picked up about five or six ripe tomatoes 
from the ground that I've moved indoors. I am going to try to get 
them to grow over the winter or at least be able to harvest the seeds
for next spring.
     </p>
     <p>
      My favorite garden center sent me an email with a number of coupons
that have induced me to go there after the Denver Broncos game (an 
expected loss to Green Bay given how they've been suffering from three
turnovers and no sacks or takeaways). I purchased a stone pot to replant
a Ficus house plant my brother gave my and wife last summer for our
wedding. I like how it looks:

      Removing Cinquefoil Bushes and Digital Timer
     </h1>
     <p>
      A couple of days ago, after prompting from my wife, I went and finally 
removed the dried out Cinquefoil bushes we had planted earlier in the
      <a href="#2019/08-04">
       summer
      </a>
      . I noticed the root ball of all but one bush were
root bound and still in the same of the plastic pots they came in. My 
best guess is that we really need to water and continue to water any
new bushes or other plants we attempt on the hill next year. Here is an
example of the one of the smaller Cinquefoil bushes on the sidewalk:

      In a less depressing topic, I found doing a web search the manual for 
the Workchoice
      <a href="img/workchoice-wc2011-manual.pdf">
       WC2011 Digital Timer
      </a>
      that I used last winter and spring to grow the
three sister
      <a href="#2019/05-03">
       seedlings
      </a>
      that never grew when I replanted
them into the backyard onion and rose bed. Now that the weather is 
starting to get cooler, I want to start again and see if I can get a
small indoor garden space going again for fall, winter, and next 
spring.

      This afternoon I took Foxy, our chow mix, for a walk down our street and 
a young fawn was spooked out of one of the Northeast neighbor's yard and
stop to watch us. I took this photo of our encounter:

     </p>

      The fawn bounded off with Foxy and I continue walking down the street.
We then broke off and followed a path through a still wild field where
as looked at these flowering bushes and grasses, I thought of how
it may look in my backyard hill after our disaster of planting 
this spring and summer. Here is the trail we were following:

      As I was thinking about how with gardens we try to enforce  our values, 
our vision, onto the land, these flowering plants reflect a baseline
that I need to do a better job of observing and integrating into 
my labor in the yards of my house and community. I like that I don't
have a back fence along my properties and the hill is wild with often
visits from deer eating along the ridge.

      Watering Onions and Roses

     <p>
      The past few days in Colorado Springs have been dry with hot days. 
Today I watered the onions in the backyard roses and onion bed:

     <p>
      <img alt="Roses and Onions watered" src="img/20190818_onions-parsely.png"/>
      . 
I selectively watered the remaining onions using a plastic bucket.
As I went back and forth filling the bucket with house water,  I 
remembered reading the news reports
about
      <a href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20191048">
       It is raining plastic
      </a>
      about microplastics found in 90% of the samples of rain water in 
Denver and Boulder. I wonder how my practices in the garden, 
like using a plastic bucket for watering, are  contributing to 
microplastic pollution in Colorado Springs?

      Onions and Roses, Purple Fungus, and Cherry Tomatoes
     </h1>
     <p>
      When I got home from Aikido practice, I started weeding the back, 
in, what I got a little chuckle in the bad pun
      <em>
       Onions and Roses
      </em>
      rock band,
      <br/>
      main growing bed in the back-yard. As I was removing the morning glories vines
from the bed as they crowd out the onions, in the photo below you can
the row of onions are next to stone wall on the right with the roses on 
the left.

      <img alt="Row in the Onions and Roses Bed" src="img/20190810_onions-roses.png"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      When I was removing these vines, I thought of my role in the garden as the 
fitness function of these adaptive systems of grow plants. My intention in 
removing unwanted plants is improve the environment for the plants that I 
want to thrive and succeed. But, I was looking at these particular morning
glory vines and how resilient and tough these plants are, I wonder for the 
2020 growing season that I plant and start early climbing peas in the same 
areas and try to grow them as a replacement in the niche currently being 
exploited to great effect by these climbing vines.
     </p>
     <h2>
      Purple Fungus
     </h2>
     <p>
      Since 2013, my first spring and summer in this house, I have notices this
purple fungus on many of the weeds in both the front and back. On the
south side of the house (what I'm now going to start call Strawberry Row,
as the strawberry plants there are doing well) there was a particularly
bad patch I took the following photo of one plant with leaves in various
stages of infection:
     </p>
     <p>
      <img alt="Purple Fungus on Plant Leaves" src="img/20190810_purple-fungus-plant-leaves.png"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      I am not sure what this fungus does or is called but since it seems to only infect
(so far as I can tell) common weeds that I would have normally picked anyways). 
I was able figure it out in 5 minutes of web research but I'll continue to look 
into this. In the meantime, when I pick these infected weeds I'm isolating them
from my two compost bins and my plan is to burn them once they dry out.
     </p>

the Rockies at
      <a href="http://boulderaikikai.org/">
       Boulder Aikikai

      ) or
haven't done much gardening other than weeding and watering the
onion bed and the new tomato plant.
     </p>
     <p>
      The four bushes my wife purchased earlier in the summer are all dried
up and look died. I'm not sure if was the lack of watering initially
or for some other reason, one problem with the bushes location on the
backyard hill is that water retention isn't great. When I went up the
hill today to look at the four bushes, I noticed green leaves sprouting
on a couple of the branches in one of the bushes picture below.

for sure.

      During my lunch 1/2 hour today, I briefly went through and weeded the
onion bed in the back yard. Most of the weeds are off-shoots of the climbing
vine that has a mass of roots through-out the bed. I imagine as an underground
network spreading out and finding its way for any opportunity to burst 
through a weak spot or sunny location in the onion bed to send up a quick
growing shoot.

      This weekend in a fit of consumer loss of will-power, I purchased a large 
cherry tomato plant within it's own container that I have put in the
front sidewalk, pictured here:

      Red and Yellow Roses (on the same bush)

     <p>
      The second largest rose bush in the back garden
recently bloomed. In the past and up until recently,
all of the Roses in the back-yard were red.

     <p>
      A couple of days ago, a yellow rose appeared and 
here is photo of the usual red roses in the 
upper-left with the new yellow rose in the

      Back from Trip &amp; Weeding
     </h1>
     <p>
      Late Wednesday night I flew back to Denver and then took the shuttle
from DIA to the Antlers Hotel in Colorado Springs. Yesterday I spent
the day mostly in bed recovering from a summer chest cold (still not
100%) but today I was able to do some weeding in the onion bed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Feeling the warmth and brightness of the sun on my face, I hope
when I'm recovering from a future illness I'll be able to garden
a bit.

      Yew Bushes Trimming &amp; Bees in the Lavender
     </h1>
     <p>
      This morning and afternoon started with picking weeds in
the both the backyard onion patch and in the lawn before I mowed.
I then shot the following video of bees and flies pollinating
      <br/>
      the lavender bushes in the front:

     <p>
      Later in the afternoon, I went back to trimming a yew bushes in the
front. Under the bushes is a rock border that I wanted to reveal 
that was over-grown. I cut them back as seen in this photo:

      Yesterday, my wife Melissa went to a large retail tool and garden center and purchased a
number of flowers for the front-yard. The red geraniums and yellow lilies really stand-out 
surrounded by the lavender bushes.

      None of the initial "three" sisters planting of corn, eggplant, and green beans came up
and since I have initial seedlings ready for planting, I decided to replant the 
available seedlings in the same location as the initial seedlings. I also and weeded
the front-yard and along the side of the house leading up to the

     <p>
      Sunday I arrived back from a professional conference in Boston and
yesterday as I was looking at the first Strawberry patch on the 
enclosed side of the house, I noticed a ripe strawberry that I picked
and enjoyed just a taste of the hopefully, more to come in the
upcoming years. On the opposite side of the house is a 
second patch strawberry patch on side of the hill pictured below:

      Second Sisters Planting
     </h1>
     <p>
      The weather this past week in Colorado Springs ranged from snow
to rain until today with the sun provided an opportunity to go outside and
engage the garden.
     </p>
     <p>
      Earlier in the spring I started a seed starter grow station in my 
garage that provide the source seeds in my first foray into a three
sister's planting. Starting withe the seedlings with the most 
growth pictured here:

compost augmented with some dirt from a purchased bag of 
garden soil:

      Yesterday I went to my new favorite
      <a href="https://www.goodearthgardencenter.com/">
       garden-center
      </a>
      and 
purchased a "
      <a href="https://smartpots.com/compostsak/">
       compost sak
      </a>
      " for the 
front yard. This morning I set-up the sack and placed next to the gate to the backyard
(see the photo below)
I picked up the remaining cuttings from my trimming the yew bushes in
the front as well as a round of weeding the front yard.

      Later in the afternoon, I weeded and watered the onion and rose bed which you see
in the second photo below. Also, you can start to get a sense of the hill in the 
backyard as well.

      I should confess that an important source of inspiration is watching through
Monty Don series on Netflix, with my wife and I watching the second episode in the
French gardens series. Today I first heard the French style of kitchen garden,
or portage, from the French word for soup, were herbs, fruits, vegetables, and 
flowers are all combined into an integrated whole with the focus on the vegetables.
Just a quick internet search turned up two articles,
      <em>

      Weeding Dandelions
     </h1>
     <p>
      The rain of the past two days in Colorado Springs resulted in a
number of dandelions popping up in the front-yard. Between meetings
this afternoon, I picked a few and then took the first photo
of my weeding tools and bucket, along with the largest patch of these
"weeds". Most weeds I don't have any qualms about removing them from the
front lawn or in the various garden beds but I am ambivalent about dandelions
because, unlike many of the weeds, they are edible and I feel like instead of
composting them, I should clean and prep them for a meal.
      <br/>
      <img alt="tools and dandelions" src="img/20190423_dandelion.jpg"/>

     <p>
      I also came across this multi-colored, that I believe is a
pansy that grew from seed as a part of last year's pansies in the front-yard beds.

      Berry Hedge Beginnings
     </h1>
     <p>
      My stepdaughter Meghan and I planted a few weeks three berry bushes,
a red raspberry, a black raspberry, and a blackberry bushes at the
top of my Pike Peak's foothill backyard. As seen in the photo below,
I labeled each of the new bushes with an unique IRI built using the EFF's dice
word-list to generate random three-word phrases as names instead of me trying
to come up with new names and ids for the plants I want to track.

      Initial Garden Reflections
     </h1>
     <p>
      Starting today, I write to reflect on today's work in my garden, 
located on the Westside of Colorado Springs. Most of my backyard is
the side of a foothill that with it's siblings, merges west into 
Pikes Peak.
     </p>
     <p>
      My current work is in a rose garden that over the past years I've lived
here, I've routated between the roses, loosely-called compost pits. 
Finally this year, I'm actually planting both onions and
