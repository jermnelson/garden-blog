       Weeding Dandelions
      </h1>
      <p>
       The rain of the past two days in Colorado Springs resulted in a
number of dandelions popping up in the front-yard. Between meetings
this afternoon, I picked a few and then took the first photo
of my weeding tools and bucket, along with the largest patch of these
"weeds". Most weeds I don't have any qualms about removing them from the
front lawn or in the various garden beds but I am ambivalent about dandelions
because, unlike many of the weeds, they are edible and I feel like instead of
composting them, I should clean and prep them for a meal.

       I also came across this multi-colored, that I believe is a
pansy that grew from seed as a part of last year's pansies in the front-yard beds.

       Berry Hedge Beginnings
      </h1>
      <p>
       My stepdaughter Meghan and I planted a few weeks three berry bushes,
a red raspberry, a black raspberry, and a blackberry bushes at the
top of my Pike Peak's foothill backyard. As seen in the photo below,
I labeled each of the new bushes with an unique IRI built using the EFF's dice
word-list to generate random three-word phrases as names instead of me trying
to come up with new names and ids for the plants I want to track.

       Initial Garden Reflections
      </h1>
      <p>
       Starting today, I write to reflect on today's work in my garden, 
located on the Westside of Colorado Springs. Most of my backyard is
the side of a foothill that with it's siblings, merges west into 
Pikes Peak.

       My current work is in a rose garden that over the past years I've lived
here, I've routated between the roses, loosely-called compost pits. 
Finally this year, I'm actually planting both onions and
