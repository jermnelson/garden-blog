# Yew Bushes Trimming &amp; Bees in the Lavender  

This morning and afternoon started with picking weeds in
the both the backyard onion patch and in the lawn before I mowed.
I then shot the following video of bees and flies pollinating  
the lavender bushes in the front:

Later in the afternoon, I went back to trimming a yew bushes in the
front. Under the bushes is a rock border that I wanted to reveal 
that was over-grown. I cut them back as seen in this photo:
