# Back from Trip &amp; Weeding
Late Wednesday night I flew back to Denver and then took the shuttle
from DIA to the Antlers Hotel in Colorado Springs. Yesterday I spent
the day mostly in bed recovering from a summer chest cold (still not
100%) but today I was able to do some weeding in the onion bed. 

Feeling the warmth and brightness of the sun on my face, I hope
when I'm recovering from a future illness I'll be able to garden
a bit.
