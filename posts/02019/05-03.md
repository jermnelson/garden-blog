# Second Sisters Planting
The weather this past week in Colorado Springs ranged from snow
to rain until today with the sun provided an opportunity to go outside and
engage the garden. 

Earlier in the spring I started a seed starter grow station in my 
garage that provide the source seeds in my first foray into a three
sister's planting. Starting withe the seedlings with the most 
growth pictured here:

Here are the seedlings near the final position in the garden 
patch before being planted this afternoon:

Here is the final planting using soil from the existing 
compost augmented with some dirt from a purchased bag of 
garden soil:
