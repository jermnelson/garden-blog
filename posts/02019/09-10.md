# Removing Cinquefoil Bushes and Digital Timer
A couple of days ago, after prompting from my wife, I went and finally 
removed the dried out Cinquefoil bushes we had planted earlier in the 
[summer](#2019/08-04). I noticed the root ball of all but one bush were
root bound and still in the same of the plastic pots they came in. My 
best guess is that we really need to water and continue to water any
new bushes or other plants we attempt on the hill next year. Here is an
example of the one of the smaller Cinquefoil bushes on the sidewalk:

In a less depressing topic, I found doing a web search the manual for 
the Workchoice [WC2011 Digital Timer](img/workchoice-wc2011-manual.pdf) 
that I used last winter and spring to grow the
three sister [seedlings](#2019/05-03) that never grew when I replanted
them into the backyard onion and rose bed. Now that the weather is 
starting to get cooler, I want to start again and see if I can get a
small indoor garden space going again for fall, winter, and next 
spring.
