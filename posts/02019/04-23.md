# Weeding Dandelions
The rain of the past two days in Colorado Springs resulted in a
number of dandelions popping up in the front-yard. Between meetings
this afternoon, I picked a few and then took the first photo
of my weeding tools and bucket, along with the largest patch of these
"weeds". Most weeds I don't have any qualms about removing them from the
front lawn or in the various garden beds but I am ambivalent about dandelions
because, unlike many of the weeds, they are edible and I feel like instead of
composting them, I should clean and prep them for a meal.

I also came across this multi-colored, that I believe is a
pansy that grew from seed as a part of last year's pansies in the front-yard beds.
