# Onions and Roses, Purple Fungus, and Cherry Tomatoes
When I got home from Aikido practice, I started weeding the back, 
in, what I got a little chuckle in the bad pun *Onions and Roses* rock band,  
main growing bed in the back-yard. As I was removing the morning glories vines
from the bed as they crowd out the onions, in the photo below you can
the row of onions are next to stone wall on the right with the roses on 
the left.

When I was removing these vines, I thought of my role in the garden as the 
fitness function of these adaptive systems of grow plants. My intention in 
removing unwanted plants is improve the environment for the plants that I 
want to thrive and succeed. But, I was looking at these particular morning
glory vines and how resilient and tough these plants are, I wonder for the 
2020 growing season that I plant and start early climbing peas in the same 
areas and try to grow them as a replacement in the niche currently being 
exploited to great effect by these climbing vines.

## Purple Fungus
Since 2013, my first spring and summer in this house, I have notices this
purple fungus on many of the weeds in both the front and back. On the
south side of the house (what I'm now going to start call Strawberry Row,
as the strawberry plants there are doing well) there was a particularly
bad patch I took the following photo of one plant with leaves in various
stages of infection:

I am not sure what this fungus does or is called but since it seems to only infect
(so far as I can tell) common weeds that I would have normally picked anyways). 
I was able figure it out in 5 minutes of web research but I'll continue to look 
into this. In the meantime, when I pick these infected weeds I'm isolating them
from my two compost bins and my plan is to burn them once they dry out.

## Cherry Tomatoes
So my cherry tomato plant impulse buy started producing and ripening small tomatoes
that I have started picking and eating once ripe! here is a close shot of a ripe
tomato on that plant that I also took today:
