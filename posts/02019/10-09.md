# Growing season Wind Down
The latest weather forecast for Colorado Springs calls for snow and drastically
reduced high temperature in 30s Fahrenheit. I decided to move the one remaining
tomato plant indoors and see if I can keep the plant alive as long as possible
in my portable grow station. This cherry tomato plant has been the most
productive plant in this season's garden adventures and it will be an interesting
experiment to see how long this plant lives indoors. I decided to hold off in 
harvesting the remaining onions in the rose bed and in the long container.
