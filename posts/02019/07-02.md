# Red and Yellow Roses (on the same bush)
The second largest rose bush in the back garden
recently bloomed. In the past and up until recently,
all of the Roses in the back-yard were red. 

A couple of days ago, a yellow rose appeared and 
here is photo of the usual red roses in the 
upper-left with the new yellow rose in the
lower right.
