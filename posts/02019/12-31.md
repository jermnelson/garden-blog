# Final Thoughts for 2019
As the last day of 2019, my garden adventures for the year are complete 
with very mixed results. I killed too many [plants](#2019/04-20) and [here](#2019/09-10),
I failed in both planting [seedlings](#2019/05-03) and from most of onions I planted int
the ground. My notable successes were with container plants, both onions and the
[cherry tomato](#2019/08-10) plant. I did a lot of [weeding](/#2019/08-04) and 
[bush removals](#2019/09-10) along with other gardening work around the house. In all, 
even though most of my ambitions was folly, documenting my experiences in this blog 
and spending time gardening was a source of deep satisfaction and humbling of my 
initial hubris. 

## 2020 New Year Garden Resolutions 
Looking over the past year, here are my gardening goals for the new year:

-   Start seedlings sooner, allow them to grow larger before planting in the
    ground and in containers
-   More of mix between in-ground plantings and container gardening
-   Plant less perennials
-   Start a drip irrigation system for at one of the new beds
