# Removal of Beds, prep for this Summer
My family and I are moving to the San Francisco Bay area this 
summer and my focus for gardening and landscaping efforts is
on selling my house. Today I took off from work and tore out 
the front-yard mentioned [here](#2020/09-26), [here](#2020/05-07),
[here](#2020/03-23) in 02020 and [here](#2019/06-07), [here](#2019/08-28)
in 02019.

The front-yard before:
