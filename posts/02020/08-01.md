# Lemon Tree First Yellow Fruit and Rosemary Bush
This morning when practicing Tai Chi on the back patio, I looked over 
to the lemon tree and saw this beautiful sight:

Of the four lemons, the first turning yellow is one of the smallest. I
am excited that one of my favorite plants is producing fruit. For the first
year, the four fruit are exciting to see. 

I dropped off Carmen at her work and on the way back I stopped off at my 
favorite garden center, [Good Earth](https://www.goodearthgardencenter.com/) and
purchased a couple of pots for a project I'm starting and I also was able to 
purchase a small Rosemary plant below:
