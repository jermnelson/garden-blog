# Tomato, Lettuce, and Red Cabbage
I went to the [Phelan Gardens](http://phelangardens.com/) after 
Aikido class today (our first since March) where we practiced 
social distancing Aiki warm-up and 7-bokken suburi. Before 
and after class we washed the mat with a water-bleach solutions. 
I purchased a tomato, four red cabbage, and a lettuce selection. 
The tomato and two of the red cabbages I planted in the cherry
tomato container from last year. The lettuce and two of the 
red cabbages I planted in the container.

Here is a photo of new tomato plant:
