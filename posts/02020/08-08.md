# Prickly Pear Cactus and Silver Sage
A large lot north on 19th has been abandoned for a while with an 
established forest. I think the lot has been sold along with the 
adjacent house so I wanted to save at least a couple of plants 
before it is developed into houses, condos, or apartments (best
scenario). 

This morning I took my new Chinese-made [Hori hori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hori_hori)
and three black cast-off soil containers to put two Prickly Pear or 
[*Opuntia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opuntia) plants along with a nearby
[sunflower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisia_cana) or *Artemisia cana*. 

This is photo is when I was digging out the first prickly pear (the Artemsisia cana
was only a meter or two away) with the Hori hori with it's orange handle
stuck in the ground.

I quickly discovered that my gloves didn't protect my hands from the very tiny
spines and for the reminder of the day I have removing the spines with tweezers 
from my fingers. 

When I got back to the house, I discover one of the two prickly pear cactus had 
white film on the underside that looked like bird guano but I don't think it was.
I first planted the *Artemsisa cana* in it's own pot and my wife took a photo 
of me at around that time below:

After finishing planting both the cactus and the silver sagebrush, I made a short 
video of my container garden, with my lemon tree, my new plants, and the seasonal 
cabbage and tomato plant:
