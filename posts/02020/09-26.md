# Maize Growing in Front Garden
During the hot summer days of July, on a whim I planted some sweet maize (corn)
in the front yard and now at the end of September, it has grown about a foot
with no chance that will grow large enough to harvest any food.

This entire growing season has been a failure, with none of the celery, onions, lettuce,
or tomatoes maturing enough for any harvest (I take that back, I was able to harvest
some lettuce for hamburgers one evening)
