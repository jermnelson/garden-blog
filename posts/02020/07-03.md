# Stella d'Oro
In the front-yard flower bed closest to the street, the mystery flower has 
finally bloomed with a couple of bright yellow flowers. My wife 
texted my mother-in-law with a photo who identified the plant as a 
[Stella d'Oro](http://www.perennials.com/plants/hemerocallis-stella-de-oro.html) 
or yellow day lily.

The rain this afternoon and early evening is beaded on the leaves in this 
photo of the Stella d'Oro:
