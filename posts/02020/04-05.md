# Installing Garden Art among the Roses
Today one my jobs was to install a piece of garden art I 
was able to pick for the Texas 2019 Christmas white elephant
gift exchange with my wife's family. Initially, I 
had installed the ceramic rain-drop inverted but after asking
my wife to confirm, I fixed and she took the following photo 
this afternoon:
