# Repotting House Tree
My brother Jacob gave my wife and I for our wedding a tree house-plant that
is now part of my container garden. I've been remiss and although I 
purchased a nice pot a couple of years for the plant, up until today I 
just kept in it's original black plastic container. Here is the tree
plant (please [email](mailto:jermnelson@gmail.com) if you know the name)
in it's new ceramic pot:
