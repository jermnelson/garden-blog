# Bayfield Garden Beds
We now live in Bayfield Colorado! Here are the garden beds in our 
backyard:

There are three raised beds in a grid with each surrounded by 4 inch wooden boards. 
Also exciting is that each of the beds has drip irrigation. The where a fourth bed
looks like it was used for compost, so we will continue to use that area for
compost.
