# Cannon Resting in Garden and News
My new dog, Cannon, was owned by deceased brother Jesse and I adopted after
my sister-in-law was no longer able to take care of him. Cannon is resting 
in front of the lemon tree and other plants on the patio in Pacifica.

In personal garden news, my wife accepted a position at Ft. Lewis College in 
Durango Colorado and we are moving in August! We are closing on a house in 
Bayfield, Colorado that is on a half-acre lot with a large garden with three
raised beds and a couple of apple trees.
