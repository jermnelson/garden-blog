# First Lemon
Today I harvested the first lemon from the lemon tree pictured below:

I sliced the lemon and the taste was surprisingly sweet with a more
of a mild lemon taste:

My wife and I enjoyed adding the lemons to some adult beverages for a
2025 New Year's treat. Consuming a fruit from a tree (or in this case more 
of a bush) offers a level of satisfaction that is missed when purchasing
fruit from the grocery store.
