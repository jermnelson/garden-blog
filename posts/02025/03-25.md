# Death, Hiking, and Cactus Garden
Yesterday, 24 March 02025, my 43 year-old brother [Jesse Robert Nelson](https://what-would-jesse-do.org)
died from a brain aneurysm. Today I took a long hike in the nearby 
[San Pedro Valley Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Pedro_Valley_County_Park) as part of my reaction
to this unexpected death. Here are some photos I took on my trail.

This hike was the beginnings of my own grief journey over Jesse's death. I needed
this nature reminder of how life continues and persists over many generations of
us humans. A sense of long time that our natural world places my grief and 
sadness in the longer context and a reminder of my own mortality.

On my walk back to our townhouse, I passed this neighbor's cactus garden that
I particularly liked:
