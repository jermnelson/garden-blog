# Apple Tree Pruning with Susan
My good friend Floyd and his partner Susan are our first guests at our new
home in Bayfield. Susan's ex-husband is a master gardener and when she saw our
two apple trees in the backyard, she wanted to help trim them for the winter.
She volunteered to prune these Granny Smith apple trees but she required a set
of pruning shears that I purchased at the local TruValue Bayfield hardware store:

Her suggestions included thinning out the lower branches in our larger apple tree,
with the result here:

For the second tree, she trimmed some of the lower branches and the offshoots.
