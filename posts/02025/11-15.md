# Garden Bed Prep for Winter
Today I used my new electric Ryobi lawnmower to mow the backyard:

Instead of putting the grass clippings in the compost garden bed as I
did previously from lawn mowing, I put them into the Southwest bed. I 
then intermixed them with some of the leaves from my raking of the front-yard:

There wasn't enough lawn clippings to do the other beds so this will create 
a natural A/B test to see if the composting the bed will improve the bed 
come next Spring/Summer. Here is the Southwest bed with the layer of 
grass clippings/leaves (about 3 inches total) with a Cannon photobomb in 
the Southeast bed:
