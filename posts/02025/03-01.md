# Replanting Ficus and Verbena 'Paseo Racho'

I replanted the Ficus into a better pot; removing the plant from it's
container, the temporary container shows how root-bound the plant had
become:

Here is the Ficus in it's new pot:

I also went to the Pacifica Public Garden, who was holding a plant 
sale, and purchased this California native *Verbene `Paseo Racho`*
grass and replanted into a new pot as well:
