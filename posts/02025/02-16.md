# Kumquat Graft to Lemon Tree
My [attempt](#02024/12-19) to start some Kumquat seedlings
failed but I decided to try grafting a small section of the 
seedling to the existing lemon tree. I lacked actual growers
tape but decided to use cellophane tape instead to keep the
new graft in place.

I'm monitoring the progress and see if this graft will take. A 
new garden experiment as the weather in Pacifica is starting to 
feel more like Spring.
