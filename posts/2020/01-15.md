# California Dreaming
For my first blog post of 2020 (and it being winter here in Colorado Springs) I 
decided to replant a lemon tree I purchased late last year into it's own pot.

When I am in Palo Alto, my cube on the Lanthrop third floor looks into a courtyard that 
contains lemons and kumquats in planters. When I was there last week, the lemons were
starting to ripen. These lemons are delicious and so inspired me to buy and try to keep
living my lemon tree. I did notice that the pot I picked is about the same size and 
container I purchased with the roots being container bound. I'll likely need to purchase 
a larger pot this summer.
