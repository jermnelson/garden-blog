# Re-potting the Lemon Tree
I think the size of the pot for my new lemon tree was too small and too much of the
root crown was exposed. I had an extra plastic container that moved the lemon tree 
into that does a better job of covering the roots and gives the tree more room to grown.
In the small window of sun shine during the 20 degree Fahrenheit day, I replanted and
took this photo (I wish it was warm as it looks, the sun in Colorado is always deceptive 
during the winter)

The bottom of the lemon tree's container has a reservoir to store extra water so I hope 
that will help reduce the occurrence of all of the soil being dried up that was part of
the issue with the smaller terracotta pot.
