# Re-potting the Lemon Tree
I think the size of the pot for my new lemon tree was too small and too much of the
root crown was exposed. I had an extra plastic container that moved the lemon tree 
into that does a better job of covering the roots and gives the tree more room to grown.

The bottom of the lemon tree's container has a reservoir to store extra water so I hope 
that will help reduce the occurrence of all of the soil being dried up that was part of
the issue with the smaller terracotta pot.
