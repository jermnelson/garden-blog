# Onions in Early March
Last fall I didn't harvest very many onions that were the Rose bed because most 
of them have died or so I assumed from the lack of green tips. Last week I 
noticed as the weather in Colorado Springs has improved, that some of those
abandoned onions are sprouting back up with the most prominent pictured 
below:

Last weekend I put on my todo list to start the seedlings for planting this
spring and I always seem to have an excuse. I need to get the light fixed and
most of the first two trays planted, perferrable this afternoon. This year
I am using cardboard egg cartons for containers to hold the seeds. The added
advantage is that I can use a pen to mark what is where.

My immediate goal is the create a three-sisters planting on a single six-egg
carton and then tranport them to the very successful cherry tomato planter from
the last year. I am curious to see if the container is too constraining for the corn 
or if all three plants (the other two being beans and squash) can survive as a well.

It would be nice if I could cultivate the three-sisters in this manner.
