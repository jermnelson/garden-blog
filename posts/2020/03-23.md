# Cleaning up Lavender Beds
This morning I worked in the front yard cleaning up the lavender beds by removing
leaves and the old stems. Here is the yard before the clean-up (along with our black
cat Rocky crossing in the background):

Removing the dead stems and leaves took some time and even then there still needs to be
another round of leave clean-up as seen in this after photo:
