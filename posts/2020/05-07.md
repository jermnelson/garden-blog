# Front Flower Beds 
My wife and step-daughters stopped by [Rick's Garden Center](http://www.ricksgarden.com/)
last night and picked up an assortment of flowers and bushes for the 
two flower beds in the front-yard. In each of the beds there is a 
Little Turdy Catmint (*Nepta psfike*) and a Gold Star Potentillas (*Potentilla fruticosa*)
plants. Tonight I planted both of the beds. In the Southern most flower bed that closet to
street and receives the most sun, we planted a Rocket City Daylily *Hemerocallis* 
and Ruby Stella *Hemerocallis*. In between these bushes we planted clusters of Ocean Breeze
and Harvest Mix Violoas:

After I planted the second Catmint plant with the purple flowers, two 
bumblebees almost immediately came and started feeding which you can see
in this photo:

Here is that bed with a new Plantain Lily Hosta that reminds me of Illinois.

In all an unexpected but wonderful mid-week gardening opportunity on this 
fine Colorado Spring evening.
