# Weeding the Front and Back Yards
My wife is doing her [DBA](https://www.uww.edu/cobe/doctorate) program from 
home this weekend due to the Covid-19 pandemic instead of traveling to Whitewater, 
Wisconsin this weekend. In the morning I weeded the dandelions in the front yard 
and noticed that the 
lavender bushes are starting to bud and should be flowering soon. In the picture
below you can see at the corner of the sidewalk there is my basket of weeds 
next to a new sage bush growing between lavender

In the backyard, I weeded the entire Onions and Roses bed and took this photo
showing the onions, roses, the Fetish Art Drop, and two steel flower decorations
that is pictured here:
