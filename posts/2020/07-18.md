# Celery Garden Scrap Transplant
This is my third or forth attempt and growing out from the stalk of celery
a new transplant. The previous attempts all failed with the celery transplants 
dying when I planted them in the back-yard onions and roses bed. This time 
I am taking a different approach and planting the celery transplant in the
the front-yard next to the flower beds.

I hope with the full sun and watering, that this attempt will be more successful
than my past attempts. I will also grow another celery transplant from my next
store purchase of celery stalks for the family meals.
