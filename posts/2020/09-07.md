# Preparing for First Freeze
Right now the temperature is in the high eighties with the air dense 
from the wild fires in Colorado and beyond. The weather is forecast 
to drastically change overnight and into tomorrow with the low being
below freezing with snow and rain! I'll be bringing inside the container
garden for the night although I hope to move them back outside at 
lease until the end of the month and maybe into October.
