# Structural Onions, Lemon Tree, and other Additions
For the past few months I've growing out celery stalks from the leftover
marketplace celery I base a lot of my cooking savory meals around especially
during the Covid-19 self-isolation and restaurants closures these past 
few months. My first attempt grew out and then died back finally shriveling
up and dying when transplanted into the orange rectangular container. 

My second celery attempt started a couple of weeks ago and is to the (healthy) I
hope the new celery stalk is ready for replanting in the backyard's Onions 
and Roses bed. The celery stalk is in a small glass jar seen between the legs of
easel (currently my third painting in the Floyd's Dreams of Dylan painting
and pirate radio [series][floyd_dreams] in the photo below of my garage biological grow hub and 
my oil painting studio:

## Bamboo Structural Support for Onions
With the onions in their second year, a couple of these have recently been
flattened by human or other means. In one of the kitchen drawers, we have 
bamboo skewers that I repurposed into structural supports for these fallen
onions tied with kite string as seen in this photo:

## Horizontal Art, Lemon Tree, Roses, Onions, and Celery
With both my wife and I working from home we both frequently look out into the
back-yard and so now in the bed we have our ceramic art fetish, my lemon tree (moved 
outdoors for the summer from inside the house), the newly supported onion, followed with 
the orange and green steel cactus art, with another onion and newly planted celery 
plant, all pictured from left-to-right in this photo from today:

I just love how both the front have improved tremendously under my wife and step-daughters
efforts over the past couple of months.
