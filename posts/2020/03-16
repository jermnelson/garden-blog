# Seed Grow Station
After being inspired last [Thursday](#2020/03-12), I started my indoors seed starting
station and went ahead and created three of the egg carton seed packs. I also planted
a micro-greens pot and in another pot planted one of the onion bulbs from last year. 
Some of the last year's seed pods were re-hydrated and planted some of the remaining
beans and squash seeds.  

In the photo below, the egg carton seed cartons in the black trey are from front to the
back:

-   The three sisters - corn, green beans, and zucchini
-   Tomatoes from the super successful cherry tomato plant from last season and pumpkin
    seeds from last fall, and some beets seeds from Ann Grant Martin
-   Arugula, Kale, and Spinach

The two brown bottles hold water and in the lower-left corner there is a couple of 
my paint brushes (my easel is adjunct to the grow station) are in jar with paint thinner.
Because of the COVID-19 virus imposed social distancing, all of my family is staying at
home. Being able to start on the cultivating seedlings for this season's garden provides
a much needed balance and connection to the larger reality beyond the fear of the 
ongoing pandemic.
