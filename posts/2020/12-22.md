# Garage Gardening Hub
Two new additions to the my garage indoor growing hub, mentioned
[earlier](#2200/06-07) this year. Today shopping for
holiday gifts at my favorite gardening nursery, [Good Earth](https://www.goodearthgardencenter.com/),
I purchased a Seed Sprouter along with Red Clover and Alfalfa seeds to 
start growing sprouts in the upcoming year. More to come. 


A few weeks ago I purchased a Landscape Drip watering system, 
seen at the bottom of the photo. Using minimal parts from the entire
kit, by the beginning of 02021, I'll be able to water any plant growth
in the upper shelf of the hub.
