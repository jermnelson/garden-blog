# Watering the Onions and Roses
Late this afternoon-to-early-evening, I decided to water the onion beds and
roses as the ground is getting dryer (not unrelated to the current emerging
[megadrought](https://www-washingtonpost-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/weather/2020/04/16/southwest-megadrought-climate-change/)) 
here in Colorado. In the picture below, you can see the art work, the line of onions with 
sprayed water.
