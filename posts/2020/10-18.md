# Container Garden Moving Indoors
The temperature in Colorado Springs definitely dropping over the past few days. 
Friday night my wife and I moved the temperate container plants indoors with 
the lemon tree moving underneath the existing coffee table growing station.

The Denver Bronco's win coupled with progress on various local art projects makes today
enjoyable despite the cold weather, the continuing Covid-19 pandemic, and the unusually
stress of 2020 elections. My garage growing station needs improvement to grow any winter 
fresh vegetables. At least improve the frequency of my winter blog posts!
