# Butterflies and Bees
The lavender bushes in the front-yard are starting to bloom with 
butterflies and bees busy pollinating as seen in this video I 
took today:

This is inspiring to see and a welcome sight. I've decided I'll be joining my 
wife for a 30 minute daily gardening session starting next Tuesday. I hope 
that my writing output on this blog will increasing accordingly for the 
2020 summer of the Covid-19 pandemic.
