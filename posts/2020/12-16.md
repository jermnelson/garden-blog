# Lemon Tree Flowering
The container lemon tree started flowering again even though there
is still one unripened lemon on the tree from the last (and only)
harvest. This time I'll try to keep more than one lemon resulting
from these flowers. The weather in Colorado Springs is cold with 
some sporadic snow that makes gardening during warmer times seem
like a pleasant dream.

Here is the best cluster of flowers from the lemon tree. Notice in the top-left corner,
a leaf that some insect snacked from this summer when the lemon tree was outside:
