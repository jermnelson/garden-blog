# Seed Sprouter Notebook and Data
I started the over-night soak for both Red Clover and Alfalfa seeds that
I'll transfer to the first layer in the Seed Sprouter I purchased earlier
in the week. I started a [Jupyter notebook][IPYNB] to manage the [data][DATA] 
I'm collecting to track the full-growth cycle for sprouting seeds to harvesting 
for two different seeds. My plan is to start the second layer after the 
first of the year.  

Here is the current set-up for the seeds being soaked in the Garden Garden
hub:
