# Visiting Ricks and Starting New Sprouts
Yesterday I stopped by [Rick's Garden Center](https://www.ricksgarden.com/) just down 
the street from my house. My stepdaughter is doing a science project for her high 
school class and needed some mulch for one of her experiments. While I was there, 
I picked up three sprouting seed packets:

- Alfalfa Seeds
- Mung Bean
- Wheatgrass

I then cleaned the residuals sprouts and seeds from the sprout growing trays and
I intend to start a new bunch of spouts tomorrow. I will also create two new
seed bottles as I have the extra bottles.
