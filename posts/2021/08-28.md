# Mowing the Front Yard
Even though the late summer has been hot and dry, the front yard
lawn continues to grow, especially the weeds and other non-grass
plants. I have been negligent in watering the front (and truth 
be told in the back onion-and-rose bed as well) but I decided
to mow the front yard, it looks better now.
