# Lemon Tree pH Test
A few months (or even a year or more), I purchased an analog pH testing
probe that I've been meaning to start testing the soil for any of the 
container or potted plants. Today I decided to test the soil for the
Lemon Tree and I looked up via an internet search, the ideal range of 
a potted lemon tree is between 5.5 and 6.5 pH. Testing the soil, I 
took a picture here:

Looking at the gauge, the soil is close to being neutral at 7, so
I will look at adding a fertilizer to make the soil slightly more
acidic. Left over from my stepdaughter's science project, I decided to
use some mulch to make a layer in the Lemon tree because the roots are 
slightly showing and provide some protection and water retention. I
am hoping that the lemon tree will flower again as it warms up and having
extra nutrients available should help. 

Next weekend my wife and I will harvest the lemon for some 
celebratory gin and tonics.
