# Onion Bed Planting
This afternoon I planted the onion bulbs I had picked up a few weeks ago,
here is the bulb packet:

The package claimed that there were 100 bulbs, I didn't count them but 
I did plant the entire packet with each build about 4 inches from each
other. The onions were planted in back roses bed which did have some
leftover bulbs growing from previous years already.
