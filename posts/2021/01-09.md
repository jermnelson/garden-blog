# Sprouts Starting in the New Year
Today's snow started earlier in the day and continues. Before I left for Aikido 
class, I went out to the garage, picked up the sprouts trays from the garden grow 
hub, and watered them in the kitchen sink. Since I started back to work last Monday,
I haven't been able to record the watering like I was intending in the
Jupyter notebook but both the Alfalfa and the Red Clover seeds started sprouting.

The garage isn't heated and so the growth of the sprouts are stunted; however,
I think the next purchase for the garden grow hub will be a heating mat. I took
the following photo from the top and you can see the Alfalfa seeds starting to 
sprout.

The grow of new life (even with these sprouts) is an appropriate as I start the next
year of my life.
