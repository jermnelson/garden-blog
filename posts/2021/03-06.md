# Planting Strawberries
A few days ago I was at a big box store had onions and strawberries starter
bulbs and plants and I picked a bag of each. Although the weather is in 
60s today here in Colorado, I am going to hold off on planting them until
later this month. However, I decided I'm going to plan one of the strawberry
plants in a pot just to see if I can get it started.
