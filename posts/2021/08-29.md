# Seed bombs on the Back Hill

My wife attended an environmental workshop at her employer and the 
participants were given "seed bombs" of native grasses and
flowers. We decided to plant them in the Rose Bed/Onion Bed
as the onions have wilted and died over the hot summer days 
with little mosture. Here is the seed bomb after we watered:
