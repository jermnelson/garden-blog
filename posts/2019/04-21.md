# Berry Hedge Beginnings
My stepdaughter Meghan and I planted a few weeks three berry bushes,
a red raspberry, a black raspberry, and a blackberry bushes at the
top of my Pike Peak's foothill backyard. As seen in the photo below,
I labeled each of the new bushes with an unique IRI built using the EFF's dice
word-list to generate random three-word phrases as names instead of me trying
to come up with new names and ids for the plants I want to track.
