# Third "Three" Sisters Planting
None of the initial "three" sisters planting of corn, eggplant, and green beans came up
and since I have initial seedlings ready for planting, I decided to replant the 
available seedlings in the same location as the initial seedlings. I also and weeded
the front-yard and along the side of the house leading up to the [second strawberry patch](#2019/05-14).

Here is result of the third "three" sisters planting with the seedlings in the ground:
