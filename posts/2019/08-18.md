# Watering Onions and Roses
The past few days in Colorado Springs have been dry with hot days. 
Today I watered the onions in the backyard roses and onion bed:

. 
I selectively watered the remaining onions using a plastic bucket.
As I went back and forth filling the bucket with house water,  I 
remembered reading the news reports
about [It is raining plastic](https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20191048) about microplastics found in 90% of the samples of rain water in 
Denver and Boulder. I wonder how my practices in the garden, 
like using a plastic bucket for watering, are  contributing to 
microplastic pollution in Colorado Springs?
