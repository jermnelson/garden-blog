# Water and Tree Removal
I watered the front cherry tomato plant in the front
year this afternoon.

Growing with the front bushes were two larger upshoots from 
tree stumps I had cut down in previous years.

Of course, since I haven't dug up these small stumps, next year I'll 
likely have to trim the saplings again in this location.
