# White-tail (*Odocoileus virgininus*) Life-cycle
This afternoon I took Foxy, our chow mix, for a walk down our street and 
a young fawn was spooked out of one of the Northeast neighbor's yard and
stop to watch us. I took this photo of our encounter:

The fawn bounded off with Foxy and I continue walking down the street.
We then broke off and followed a path through a still wild field where
as looked at these flowering bushes and grasses, I thought of how
it may look in my backyard hill after our disaster of planting 
this spring and summer. Here is the trail we were following:

As I was thinking about how with gardens we try to enforce  our values, 
our vision, onto the land, these flowering plants reflect a baseline
that I need to do a better job of observing and integrating into 
my labor in the yards of my house and community. I like that I don't
have a back fence along my properties and the hill is wild with often
visits from deer eating along the ridge. 

Funny enough, when I got back home and went out back there was a 
magnificent buck resting at the top of my property line pictured 
in silhouette pictured here:
