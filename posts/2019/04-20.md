# Initial Garden Reflections
Starting today, I write to reflect on today's work in my garden, 
located on the Westside of Colorado Springs. Most of my backyard is
the side of a foothill that with it's siblings, merges west into 
Pikes Peak. 

My current work is in a rose garden that over the past years I've lived
here, I've routated between the roses, loosely-called compost pits. 
Finally this year, I'm actually planting both onions and 
[three sisters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Sisters_(agriculture))
of first nation origin.
