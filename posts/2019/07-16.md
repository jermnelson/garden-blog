# Onion Bed Weeding and new Cherry Tomato Container
During my lunch 1/2 hour today, I briefly went through and weeded the
onion bed in the back yard. Most of the weeds are off-shoots of the climbing
vine that has a mass of roots through-out the bed. I imagine as an underground
network spreading out and finding its way for any opportunity to burst 
through a weak spot or sunny location in the onion bed to send up a quick
growing shoot.

This weekend in a fit of consumer loss of will-power, I purchased a large 
cherry tomato plant within it's own container that I have put in the
front sidewalk, pictured here:
