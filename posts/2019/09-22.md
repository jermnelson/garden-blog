# Back from Sweden; Tomatoes and Garden Center
Last week I was in Stockholm at the National Library for a conference 
where I presented on two different panels related to my work as software
engineer. Before I left, I thought I gave instructions for watering
the cherry tomato plant that is now in the backyard. This morning I
harvested three tomatoes and picked up about five or six ripe tomatoes 
from the ground that I've moved indoors. I am going to try to get 
them to grow over the winter or at least be able to harvest the seeds
for next spring.

My favorite garden center sent me an email with a number of coupons
that have induced me to go there after the Denver Broncos game (an 
expected loss to Green Bay given how they've been suffering from three
turnovers and no sacks or takeaways). I purchased a stone pot to replant
a Ficus house plant my brother gave my and wife last summer for our
wedding. I like how it looks:
