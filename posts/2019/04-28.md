# New Compost Bag, Onion and Roses Bed
Yesterday I went to my new favorite [garden-center](https://www.goodearthgardencenter.com/) and 
purchased a "[compost sak](https://smartpots.com/compostsak/)" for the 
front yard. This morning I set-up the sack and placed next to the gate to the backyard
(see the photo below)
I picked up the remaining cuttings from my trimming the yew bushes in
the front as well as a round of weeding the front yard.

Later in the afternoon, I weeded and watered the onion and rose bed which you see
in the second photo below. Also, you can start to get a sense of the hill in the 
backyard as well.

I should confess that an important source of inspiration is watching through
Monty Don series on Netflix, with my wife and I watching the second episode in the
French gardens series. Today I first heard the French style of kitchen garden,
or portage, from the French word for soup, were herbs, fruits, vegetables, and 
flowers are all combined into an integrated whole with the focus on the vegetables.
Just a quick internet search turned up two articles, *[Learn to How to Create a Potager: A French Kitchen Garden](https://www.bbg.org/gardening/article/potager)* and 
*[How to Design a Potager Garden](https://www.growveg.com/guides/how-to-design-a-potager-garden/)*.
