# Strawberry Patch Two
Sunday I arrived back from a professional conference in Boston and
yesterday as I was looking at the first Strawberry patch on the 
enclosed side of the house, I noticed a ripe strawberry that I picked
and enjoyed just a taste of the hopefully, more to come in the
upcoming years. On the opposite side of the house is a 
second patch on side of the hill pictured below:
