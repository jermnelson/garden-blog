# Lemon Tree and a New Year
The new year brought mild temperatures during the day while still getting 
cold at night. We did have one snow storm last week in Colorado Springs 
with snow patches still remaining in the shade. The lemon tree (more like a 
lemon shrub) sole lemon approches full ripe so I'll be picking it soon.
