# Snow in May
I took the following photo of our back-yard patio after today's 
late May snow-storm.

As typical of Colorado Springs weather, the
previous weeks was beautiful with the false-promise of Spring. We
need the moisture and I had to go to both the front and back to 
shake snow out of the trees otherwise they were at risk of breaking.
My neighbor had significant damage to the pine tree in their 
front-yard. Most of the trees in Colorado Springs were planted after
the town was founded in the late 1800s by General Palmer.
