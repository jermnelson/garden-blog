# Pacifica in December
With this being my first winter in Pacifica, I've observed a couple of things related
to my ongoing gardening efforts (or lack thereof). The first is that although it never
freezes (or hasn't yet) it still is cold at night with temperatures dropping into the 30s or
40s Fahrenheit. This past weekend we experienced sun but the previous couple of weeks we had
rain every day. My sprouts are doing well with the moisture but I do need to clean the containers
and keep emptying the bottom container. I also earlier in the month planted the remains of celery
stalk and that seems to be doing well.

I've also been looking at the [classes](https://cesanmateo.ucanr.edu/?calendar=yes&g=72662) 
available at the local UC Extension office after reading an off-hand comment made in a 
recent [blog post][TYLER_BLOG_POST] by Tyler Cowen on recent advances in LLM and in particular 
[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/):

While my gardening talent and skills are at best marginal (bad pun), I am interested in improving
and learning more about how I can become better at both. Given that my space now is limited to a 
concrete slab and indoor plants, I feel like volunteering a community garden as part of certification
process for a master gardener would be a good step (although reading about the requirements for the
master gardener certification including background checks, seems a bit arduous).
