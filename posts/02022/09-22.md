# A Pacifica First - Prepping the Sprouts Tray
I am no longer living in Colorado! My house, the principle 
place as a subject for this blog is to be sold on October 5th.
I definitely have mixed feelings &#9785; but I am so 
excited to be living less than 2 miles from Pacifica 
State Beach!!

We are renting a town-home with a concrete deck bordered
by 8 foot-tall wooden fence. Because of import restrictions,
I gave away my lemon tree (origin Florida) and other plants 
so I am definitely starting anew with a total container 
garden. One of the many great things living in this 
surprising sunny microclimate, is that I'll be able to 
garden year-around! 

Expect more blog posts (and back fill the last posts from 
Colorado. 

Attached to the patio is a small laundry room that I'm 
also using for my art projects and gardening supplies. 
Inspired by one my favorite writers, [Om Malik](https://om.co/about/),
recent blog post [Why (and how) of blogging](https://om.co/2022/09/16/why-and-how-of-blogging/),
he quotes and links to Robin Rendle's 
[Take Care of Your Blog](https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/take-care-of-your-blog-/),
I'll continue writing and posting my photos and videos.

Tonight, I unpacked my sprouts grower appliance and 
prepped it with seeds while on the dryer, and put 
my first grow bed outside on the patio.

Here is the set-up:
