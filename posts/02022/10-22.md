# Pacifica Walk
Living in a townhome community in Pacifica that borders running water, direct from my
front-door a private sidewalk follows the stream through the complex. I took the
following photos as an interested gardener.

I am hoping these mushrooms are *[Laetiporus sulphureus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laetiporus_sulphureus)* but they are communal resource and a very a real risk of being poisonous. 


One of my neighbor has a large and aspiration citrus container tree:

My next plant purchase is going to be a citrus container tree of my own.
