# Kumquat Clippings and Lemon Self Portrait
I recently took two clippings from a Kumquat tree in an attempt
to them root and become the latest in my citrus orangery (sans oranges
at this time!). After applying root powder, here are the clippings
in a temporary pot:

My first lemon fruit is close to being ready to harvest, I took this
self-portrait with the out-of-focus in lemon:

This is likely my last post for 02024, one of my 02025 New Year
resolutions is to write a blog post at least once a month.
