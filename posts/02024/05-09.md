# Measuring and Watering Lemon Tree and Salvia Amistad
I am writing this blog post on my new iPad's Github App.

A few weeks ago my wife purchsed this *Salvia Amistad* to attract
hummingbirds to our patio. Pictured below:

One of the features of the iPad is that it's camera can
be used to measure objects. I tried using it on the 
lemon tree:

The weather has been great the past couple of days so I'm
working on my patio garden for the summer. I will post
another blog post on Saturday.
