# Measuring and Watering
I am writing this blog post on my new iPad's Github App.

A few weeks ago my wife purchsed this *Salvia Amistad* to attract
hummingbirds to our patio. Pictured below:

You can see this plant in earlier pictures from these
blog posts:

One of the features of the iPad is that it's camera can
be used to measure objects. I tried using it on the 
lemon tree.
