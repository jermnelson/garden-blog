# Beginning of Lemons?
This weekend I continue to prune flowers from the lemon tree (seen below)

I noticed on some of the flowers that had lost their petals, a small 
yellow bud that I believe are the beginnings of the lemon fruits.

Here is one of the nascent fruits:

In this photo, you can see all of the phases of the lemon flowers; 
from the flower bud, to the flower, to two of the beginning lemons:

One of the great things about gardening is that this question will be answered as 
time passes and will resolve the hypothesis as evidence comes in (i.e. Lemon or not)
