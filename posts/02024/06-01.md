# Red Dwarf Jade Plant
A few weeks ago I purchased on sale a *Crassula ovata* or "Crosby's Dwarf",
commonly called a Red Dwarf Jade Plant (not be confused by the enjoyable 
British classic television show [Red Dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dwarf)).

My wife and step-daughter purchased a pot for the Red Dwarf Jade Plant and on Saturday
I re-potted the Jade Plant into it's new pot:

Here is the Red Dwarf Jade in it's new pot:

We decided that our front entrance, that has a small table and two chairs, would be
the best place to put the new Red Dwarf Jade Plant:
