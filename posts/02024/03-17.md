# Replanting Dracaena and Lemon Tree
It has been over six months since I wrote in this blog. I have 
found less garden-related material since we moved to Pacifica and
our townhome's back patio doesn't have any soil for plants. However,
over the weekend I re-potted a sick [Dracaena](https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/dracaena-plants-our-best-tips-for-growing-and-care-240389) 
into a new pot, changing out the soil because we believe one of the
pets when we lived back in Colorado Springs had urinated on the tree.
My lemon tree was still in the yellow plastic pot from the store so 
I decided to clean and re-use the Dracaena's pot and replant the Dracaena
in a new pot. This photo is the work-in-progress (and I actually feel 
like a gardener!):

Here is the cleaned pot prior to re-planting the lemon tree:

After finishing transplanting Dracaena's new pot:

And finally, the new Lemon Tree in it's new pot (along with it's old pot)!
