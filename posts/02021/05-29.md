# Stir-fry with Onion Greens
Augmenting Chinese take-out from the night before, I added kale, mushrooms, 
and carrots and began cooking them in my small wok. As I didn't have any 
onions available, I went outside and clipped some green stalks from the 
growing onions in the back onion bed. Here they are before chopping:

Here is the wok cooking with all of the vegetables:
