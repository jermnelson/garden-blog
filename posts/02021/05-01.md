# Mayday Planting Onions, Tomato, and Peppers
Today being the first of May and in solitary and celebration with all of the workers in the
world that make our lives possible, I decided to finish planting the onions in the Rose
beds. Early afternoon I went to my favorite Garden Center, [Good Earth][GEARTH], and purchased two seedlings bundles of Walla Walla onions and planted them 
among the roses and the art we have in the back beds:

At [Good Earth][GEARTH] I also purchased a Fantastico cherry tomato plant for the container 
and two pepper plants I put into a pot you can see on the side:
