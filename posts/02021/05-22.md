# Weeding Onion Beds (and a photo-bomb by Teddy)
The onions are growing well over the past couple of weeks
with almost daily rain showers. The onions aren't the only
growth with the weeds starting to fill in the gaps and even
in some cases displacing the young onions. As I was finishing
up and taking a picture, our new kitten, Teddy, decided to
hunt grasshoppers and you can see him about to lunge in 
the upper right of this photo:
