# Fall/Failing Garden
Here is a photo I took of the frost-hit cherry tomato plant in a container:

As you can see, I failed to harvest the remaining tomatoes, which symbolizes
my lack of effort on my garden over the summer. I didn't water the onion beds
enough (you can't just garden over the weekends) with the resulting failure of
any harvest-able onions. I'll just leave the blubs over the winter and hopefully
in the spring, I'll do better job in 2022.
