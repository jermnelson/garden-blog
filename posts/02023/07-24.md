# San Pedro Hike
Where we live in Pacifica allows for a short walk to [San Pedro Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Pedro_Valley_County_Park).
Yesterday, I walked the [Old Trout Farm Trail](https://www.smcgov.org/parks/trail/old-trout-farm-loop-trail) and 
took the following photographs of the massive Tasmanian blue gum (*Eucalyptus globulus*) trees that surround the trail.

Also present are Redwoods pines and a lot of ferns in the undergrowth.
